# Predicting Car Prices 
**Automobile Data Set** is created by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer and is shared by UCI on its archive named as **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

My aim is **to predict car prices by creating a model based on the features of the cars listed in the dataset.** I used Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regressor models in this project. Random Forest Regressor has shown a better result as a prediction model.
